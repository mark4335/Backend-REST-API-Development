# Backend REST API Development Project Notes

## Project Structure & Technologies

- **Node.js + TypeScript**: REST API using Express.js, organized into controllers, services, models, routes, and middlewares.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database integration via TypeORM or Prisma. DB config managed with environment variables.
- **Monitoring**: New Relic integration for performance monitoring.
- **AWS EC2 Deployment**: Deployment scripts using SSH/SCP stored in `scripts/`.
- **GitHub Workflow**: Feature branches, pull requests, code reviews, and workflows in `.github/`.
- **Logging & Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and logging (Winston or Pino).
- **Security & Performance**: Helmet, rate limiting, input validation, query optimization, and caching.

## Setup Plan

1. **Initialize Node.js + TypeScript project**
   - Express.js for REST endpoints
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Folder structure: `src/controllers`, `src/services`, `src/models`, `src/routes`, `src/middlewares`

2. **Database Integration**
   - Install and configure TypeORM or Prisma
   - Create migration and seeder scripts
   - Store DB credentials in `.env`

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add New Relic agent and configuration

4. **Deployment**
   - Write deployment scripts for SSH/SCP
   - Document deployment steps

5. **GitHub Workflow**
   - Set up `.github/workflows` for CI/CD, linting, and tests
   - Use pull requests for code reviews

6. **Logging & Error Handling**
   - Integrate logging library
   - Implement error handling middleware

7. **Security & Performance**
   - Add helmet, rate limiting, and input validation
   - Optimize queries and add caching where needed

## Best Practices

- Modular code organization
- Use environment variables for sensitive config
- Write unit and integration tests
- Document API endpoints and usage
- Regularly review and refactor code for performance and security

## Collaboration

- Use GitHub for version control and code reviews
- Communicate via issues and pull requests
- Share deployment and troubleshooting notes
